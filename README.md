## Introduction
● Online Book Store is a platform which users have capability of reaching and buying books from a
large variety of products by their own preference. Our project is based on the logic of books being sold by a
supplier rather than the users selling their books to each other. We can give an example from other
companies working in this concept such as D&R, Dost Kitabevi etc.

● The main purpose of choosing this concept is just a design preference. It offers us some benefits
such as avoiding illegal copies and pirated products. In addition, our other goals in this project are creating
secure payment methods, good architectural design on backend side, safe and advantageous innovations
and services and so on.

## User Environment
When a user enters the web application, admin makes sure that system access time is on a acceptable level for
users to not be bothered with access times. When a user is connected to our system, users may want to categorize
books in order to reach books they desire to buy. Categorization key may include prize, book category, popularity
etc.. Coders, especially database managers must provide these search keys. After users find their desired books, they
may use discount coupons before making the purchase, database managers appointed to check if coupon is valid or
not.. After coupons are checked, payment part is handled by an external application. On the upcoming time support
system controls customer satisfaction for their purchased products. Support system handles that by analyzing
refunds, user reviews and tickets.
The time for any task in environment is up to the user. So, it is changing. For example, a user can filter books,
select desired book and make the payment. The time that is spent by user to perform these activities is changing by
user’s decision. But there is an activity independent from user. The product that is added to the shopping cart will
remain for 5 minutes (it can be changed by developers). So this is the unchangeable situation.
Our application will be accessible over the internet, every user who wants to use our application only needs
internet connection but the main working platform is through browsers. In the future,, we may consider the
integration of the application to mobile devices.
Our application needs to integrate with third-party payment applications such as Visa, PayPal, MasterCard etc.
